# About me:
Hi I'm Cheng. I'm a Junior studying computer science at UCSD right now.



I love how every programming tutorial starts by showing you how to print "Hello world!". For example, in Python, it is
```
print("Hello world!")
```

A quote from Kazuo Ishiguro that I really like is the following:
>"There was another life that I might have had, but I am having this one."


_As a programmer, I have written most of my code in C++ and Java. But I have also written some code in C, Python and R as well._
